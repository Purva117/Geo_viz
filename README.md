# Geo Viz

The code can show and save road networks, selective green fields, and water body data of any city by given coordinates within a radius of 15 km. The radius and location coordinates can be changed in the Main.ipynb file.

The code already has the coordinates of Dresden, DE in place and gives an output file by the name "Dresden_city_plot.png". Of course, the file name is also changeable in the code.

Here, the Python libraries namely, "osmnx" and "networkx" have been used for extracting data and plotting networks respectively.
